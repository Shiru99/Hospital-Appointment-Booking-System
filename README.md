# Appointment booking system for Patient

## Description

There are two main features in this project, the patient can book an appointment in an available slot and the doctor can view his bookings after log-in. The patient should register and sign in to book an appointment. To achieve this we are using two tables, one for a doctor having fields date and slots & another for patients whose fields will be their details, doctor name, and date of appointment along with slots.
